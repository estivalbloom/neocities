							Just a simple demo of the effect with no interactivity. The water height is generated
							using 3D simplex noise with domain warping. That texture is sampled from two locations
							with different X and Y offsets that are added together for the final water height, to
							get the effect of waves traveling in different directions. The height is used to
							calculate the water normal at each pixel, which is used to calculate the reflectance of
							the water with the fresnel equations, as well as the refraction angle based on camera
							angle parameters. Two different camera angle values can be used for the refraction and
							reflection calculations for finer control of the final look. The shader is capable of
							aligning the refraction to the pixel grid, but I found I preferred higher resolution
							refraction. Light absorbance is calculated based on the estimated path length of light
							through the water for each pixel. Then the shader blends from from the water color to
							the color where the refracted ray hits based on the absorbance, and from that to white
							based on the reflectance. The reflectance value is discretized to 16ths to give the
							reflection a more reduced-color-palette look. If the water is less than a certain depth,
							it is colored white for the foam.
						</p>
						<p>
							Ideally in the future I'd like to implement some sort of ray tracing or ray marching
							type of solution to better calculate how the color of the water is applied, calculate
							where the refracted light hits, and generate realistic caustics. I may also want to add
							a dithering effect; currently there's a trade off between having the posterization color
							depth higher to avoid color banding, and lower to help hide the shape of the noise
							texture used.
