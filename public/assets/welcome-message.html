	Welcome to the site! It is still extremely under construction; but I'm finally starting to get this thing properly filled out and I've actually got some fun stuff here! Enjoy your stay :3
</p>

<p>
	To-do:
	<ul id="welcomeList">
		<li>Make backgrounds for the code+art pages</li>
		<li>Add a gallery of Kandi I've receieved from other people</li>
		<li>Add social links (or really anything that gives me an excuse to add desktop icons outside of these windows)</li>
		<li>Add more fun windows 98 features</li>
		<li>Figure out how to make the terminal game page accessible to keyboard-only users</li>
	</ul>
