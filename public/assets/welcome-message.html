	Welcome to the site! It is still extremely under construction; so content here is pretty sparse and not entirely functional yet. But it's getting updated pretty much daily! So enjoy your stay and come back soon :)
</p>

<p>
	To-do:
	<ul id="welcomeList">
		<li>Implement more accessibility features (partly done, still need focus-looping)</li>
		<li>Figure out what I want the sub-pages to actually look like</li>
		<li>Add a gallery of Kandi I've receieved from other people</li>
		<li>Add social links</li>
		<li><span style="position: relative;">Update the logo<span style="position: absolute; left:0px; right: 0px; top: 6px; height: 1px; background-color: black;"></span></span> Honestly it's growing on me</li>
		<li>Add more fun windows 98 features</li>
	</ul>
