Welcome to the site! It is still extremely under construction; so content here is pretty sparse and not entirely functional yet. But it's getting updated pretty much daily! So enjoy your stay and come back soon :)

To-do:
	★ Add a blog
	★ Implement more accessibility features
	★ Figure out what I want the sub-pages to actually look like
	★ Get my games and demos on here and playable in-browser
	★ Add a gallery of Kandi I've receieved from other people
	★ Add social links
	★ <span style="position: relative;">Update the logo<span style="position: absolute; left:0px; right: 0px; top: 6px; height: 1px; background-color: black;"></span></span> Honestly it's growing on me
	★ Add more fun windows 98 features
