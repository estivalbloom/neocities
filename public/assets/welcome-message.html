Welcome to the site! Hopefully there'll be something interesting here soon. Those links to the right don't actually work yet, so there's not much to do other than admire the design.

Most of what's here (and basically everything I plan to add) is made by me from the ground up, with the exception of the incredible <a href="https://jdan.github.io/98.css/">98.css</a>
