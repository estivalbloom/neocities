Pronouns: They/Them

Hi! I'm Esti. That's not my actual name; EstivalBloom is my username on Oldschool Runescape. I was trying to come up with themed names for my accounts and went with seasons, but for some reason you can't put the word "Summer" in your name, which is when I learned that the word "Estival" means "having to do with summer," the same way that "Autumnal," "Hibernal," and "Vernal" refer to the other seasons. In fact, if an animal goes dormant during the summer rather than the winter, it's called "Estivation"!

I love animals (my family's got a dog and I've got a cat), painting my nails, and sushi. This website is part of my ongoing effort to start consistently spending my time creating. Hope you find something you enjoy!
