I got this walking over a bridge leading away from a festival; there were essentially only two ways to leave, so it was just a mile-long stream of people. Some girl had speakers out and was playing more music. I talked to her for a few minutes and she traded me this."

Each of us has the wristband in their favorite color, and then a single bead for each of the other 3. I even made sure it's in the same order on all 4, so each one has the full information needed to recreate the other 3 exactly."

It's so damn pretty, I love it so much."
