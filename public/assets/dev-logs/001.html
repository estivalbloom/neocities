	Hello Neocities!
</p>

<p>
	I've really been enjoying getting started on this website. I made the book icon for this page today, honestly got way more into it than I expected. It's nothing crazy, but was kind of a step up for me in quality, and I'm proud of it.

	I've been getting into a good rhythm of updating this thing today. Often I have trouble finishing projects once the initial interest wears out. Every so often I lose a little motivation, but I really want a central place to put all of my projects, and I keep finding little things to do that are satisfying. Probably isn't helped by how much effort I throw into random tiny things. Like how it occurred to me today that I'm not gonna be happy unless I implement a custom scrollbar to mimic the original windows 98 one. But the little things like that make me happy :)

	I also wound up losing a good portion of the day tweaking the portrait in my bio. I went to go back in just to add a few accessories but just kept finding more things I wanted to change. I'm glad I did - I like the updated one much better - but I really planned on getting more of the actual site done today. It's one of those things where by the end of the day I have to force myself to stop making changes or else I'll just never be finished

	I managed to get the coding projects page partly together at least. Plan for tomorrow, now that I have an idea of how I'm structuring the site, is to get accessibility features better implemented. It's still a bit of a blind spot for me, so it'll be nice to practice.

	Think that's all for today. Thanks for reading!
