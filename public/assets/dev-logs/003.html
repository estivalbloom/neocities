	Hiya Neocities!
</p>

<p>
	So this past week or so the first big thing I've been working on for the website is adding minesweeper. It just doesn't feel like I'm <strong>really</strong> mimicking windows 98 properly if you can't play minesweeper. Eventually I plan to at least add solitaire as well, but I'm not really in any rush for that one. Honestly I don't know how microsoft didn't immediately go under when someone added minesweeper to their OS; it's a miracle any work got done the instant there was easy access to minesweeper. I keep randomly losing 20 minutes at a time "testing" it. Though honestly, that's why I wanted to have it on the site so badly.

	Something I've been making a concious effort about with this site is that I try to get the interface and UI to be a pixel-perfect match to windows 98, but all of the sprites and other assets I make from scratch. I had a lot of fun with the minesweeper sprites; since the scoreboard on minesweeper mimics a 7-segment display, I went with a weird 8-segment display I learned about from a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@TechnologyConnections">Technology Connections</a> video. It kind of sucks in my opinion, most of the numbers get a slightly prettier shape but the 0 and the 6 in particular I think look <strong>horrible</strong>. However, for me, it sucks in just the right retro-tech way. It's grown on me and I love it now, and if I didn't want things to be kinda shitty I wouldn't be designing my entire website to mimic Windows 98 :). I'm also pretty proud of the execution on my 8-segment font; I spent a good while experimenting with it to get it reading the right way.

	Making the <a href="/src/kandi">Kandi catalogue page</a> the other night got me to finally break out the DSLR I've had sitting in its case unused for a couple of years now. I like bouncing between a lot of hobbies but I've had trouble actually keeping up with them until pretty recently (thank you, ADHD meds). My cat was very interested in all of the beads being moved around so I took the opportunity to get a few nice pictures of her as well :) I'll have to add another spot on the site for pictures of her sometime soon. Maybe I should modify my galleries to allow multiple pictures in a single entry somehow.

	A lot of the other stuff I've done on the site recently has been kinda backend without much to show off, sadly. Features like getting window titles into the taskbar and the highlight on the main page desktop icons that were a lot of work for a small effect. Also setting up some automation with Vite so I don't have to manually boilerplate as much between pages, and starting to set up my css to make the site mobile-friendly (this page being one of the few where I actually finished). Happy to do those kinds of things; it's worth it for the total result, but not much to show off.
</p>

	I do imagine I'll have some pretty cool stuff coming soon though - this website is getting pretty close to a point where I'd feel comfortable not describing it as "under construction" on the homepage, and once it's at a point that I'm satisfied it's "complete" I can start on other projects again. The main reason I made all this is to host them all in one spot, so I'm really excited to start filling the site out. Not much to report other than that. I finally got my ears pierced for the first time about a week ago. I'd post a picture but they're just kind of simple black stones, and my hair is kind of a disaster right now. Really excited about putting fun ones in once my ears heal though!

	Until next time, Neocities!
