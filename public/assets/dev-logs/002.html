	Hi Neocities!
</p>

<p>
	I'm finally starting to get this together enough that it's feeling less like a work in progress and more like a proper site. I was kinda caught off-guard at how easy it was to get my Godot projects on here. I spent the past couple of days learning a bit more about developing to support accessibility tools and updating the site in-kind. There's still a few things I've gotta fix up, (namely the gallery) but it's getting there! The state of accessible web dev is honestly wild to me. Lot's of things that you'd expect would just be part of the standards by now, but apparently best practice is finding weird hacks to get your site to play nicely with accessibility tools. Sucks too, because I'm sure some people just give up at that point rather than implement them.

	I think the next piece of content I want to get onto the site is a catalogue of the Kandi I've received from strangers at shows. I've been wanting to do this for a while because I've been having a harder time remembering the people I've gotten some of them from and I really don't want to forget. Plus I recently thought I lost my most important one, so I'm very eager to put together a record of them. Been thinking I'll get some colorful construction paper to use as backgrounds :)

	As usual today when I went to make some new art from the site I wound up spending all my time making something completely different instead. I still find it really hard to sit down and make a specific thing; like I got really excited a few weeks ago about the idea of learning to produce music so that I could make some for games, but after really enjoying messing around and making whatever, I couldn't get myself to sit and put together something with a specific vibe for a specific level (ADHD certainly doesn't help there). In both cases I'm still happy with the things I <i>did</i> end up making, but it's frustrating when I have goals for bigger projects. Honestly just the fact that I'm keeping up with this site is progress for me.
